        Industrial and biomedical applications of metamaterials for the control of acoustic beams.
        <br><br>
        In this project, we propose to combine new air-coupled ultrasound transducers with hyperbolic metamaterials to design vision systems that exceed the imaging capabilities of traditional systems. We will investigate the application of acoustic hyperlenses in the biomedical context to image beyond the diffraction limit, enabling imaging with deep sub-wavelength resolution. In addition, we will investigate the capabilities of air-coupled chiral hyperlenses and Bessel beams to manipulate objects, aiming to efficiently trap, move and rotate microparticles on the subwavelength scale. The results of this project could have a wide application in biomedical applications but also in agri-food and industrial applications.
